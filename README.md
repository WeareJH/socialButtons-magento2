# SocialButtons-magento2
Free magento2 plugin to place share and like buttons on product pages. Social networks implemented:
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Pinterest
- Google+

Tested and working on magento 2.1.5 & Luma (other themes can and will vary).

# Installation
- Extract over your magento installation.
- php bin/magento setup:upgrade
- php bin/magento setup:di:compile
- php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy

# Usage
All of the buttons are disabled initially. Go to Stores/Configuration/thousandmonkeys/Social Buttons to enable each button individually. If you want facebook stats create and enter an app id (optional).

If you wish to move the buttons override thousandmonkeys/SocialButtons/view/frontend/layout/catalog_product_view.xml in your theme (particularly the move command). You may also need to override the rule in thousandmonkeys/SocialButtons/view/frontend/web/css/social.css to get the facebook buttons aligned.
